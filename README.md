# Preprocessing_data_techniques 🎍 🔥 🔥

**We deal with a lot of raw data in the real world. **
Machine learning algorithms expect data to be formatted in a certain way before they start the training process. 

In order to prepare the data for ingestion by machine learning algorithms, we have to pre process it and convert it into the right format. 

**Let's see how to do it by using different kinds of techniques to achieve the right format.**
